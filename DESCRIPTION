Description: Quantifying similarity between high-dimensional single cell samples is challenging, and usually requires
    some simplifying hypothesis to be made. By transforming the high dimensional space into a high dimensional grid,
    the number of cells in each sub-space of the grid is characteristic of a given sample. Using a Hilbert curve
    each sample can be visualized as a simple density plot, and the distance between samples can be calculated from
    the distribution of cells using the Jensen-Shannon distance. Bins that correspond to significant differences
    between samples can identified using a simple bootstrap procedure.
